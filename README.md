* Created: 2023
* Author: Erik Johnson

This SPA (Single Page Application) is built using React (v18), Node.js (v18), Express.js (v4) and MongoDB and Mongoose (v7). This project is designed to
allow users to authenticate, share a location with other users and view those locations via Google maps API. This application also features:

* Mongoose ODM (Object Data Modeling library)
* Mongo Atlas cloud database or local database option
* Authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
* Axios (HTTP requests library)
* Multer (File uploads / image processing library)
* Google Maps (Map and Geocoding API)
* Custom React hooks
* MVC design

## Notes
MongoDB database dump included in "db" directory for import. Login with username "test@example.com" and password "test12345". Alternatively, remove ".example" from the
 config.env.example configuration file and update the DATABASE sections with your custom settings to register a new user.
